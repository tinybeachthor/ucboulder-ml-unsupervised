# CSCA5632 Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning Final Project

Discover hidden similarities in recipe data.

1. group cuisine similarities
2. assign cuisine (influences) to arbitrary recipes
3. suggest ingredients pairings

We will use the following datasets:
1. small dataset of `cuisine -> [ingredients]` (24 cuines, ~30
   ingredients)
2. large dataset of `recipe -> [ingredients]` (200k)
